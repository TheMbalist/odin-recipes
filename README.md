# odin-recipes
This is a project created under The Odin Project.
This project is a simple recipie website that allows the user to access recipies via the homepage and go to the various other pages to get the ingredients and steps.
the skills demonstarted are creating an html file, adding images, ordered and unordered lists, the importance of using the correct H tag andv how to use anchor tags for both relative and absolute links.
I really enjoyed this small project. Even with my prior knowledge of basic HTML, I lerned a lot more about how and why certain things work and was able to complete the project with more undrstangin than just memorisng what things are.
